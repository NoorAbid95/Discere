# Discere  
> *An AI-powered knowledge hub built with PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js (TypeScript).*  

---

## Status  
This project is currently a **Work in Progress (WIP)**. Core features and architecture are being developed and may change frequently.  

---

## About the Project  
At its core, Discere is about making your own knowledge more accessible. Instead of letting notes, lectures, articles, or documents pile up in different places, you’ll be able to bring them into one hub — and then actually *use* them.  

With Discere you can:  
- Upload your notes, lectures, or reference material  
- Ask an AI agent questions directly about your content  
- Get clear, contextual answers and summaries tailored to what you’ve uploaded  
- Interact through a clean, intuitive interface designed to make learning and revisiting material effortless

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript, Tailwind planned)  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (TypeScript)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM planned)  
- **AI Integration**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture using vector DB (planned)  
- **Other**: Docker (planned), Deployment on cloud platform (TBD)
